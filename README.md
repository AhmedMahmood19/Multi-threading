### 2. Quick Sort
### 3. Harmonic Progression

## Contents:
### /multithreaded
>multi-threaded version of the 3 algorithms written in **.c**
### /normal
>single-threaded version of the 3 algorithms written in **.c**
### /graph 
> * **.csv** files containing statistics produced by the **.c** programs 
> * **.png** files that are the images of the graphs
### /scripts
> * **.py** files that plot the graphs using the **.csv** files and saves them as **.png** files
> * the **___timing.sh** files compile and run their respective **___.c** programs while varying the parameters and records the time taken to run with each parameter and stores the statistics in **.csv** files
> * the **runall.sh** file compiles and runs the whole project in one go
